Black friday is one of the creative sales idea in the history. Everyone would be waiting that day to get discounted products. Ecommerce is the most benefited sector by far. Data will show us how its important to check sells and market movment in that day. I have used Kaggle Data to see.  Some of this questions will draw better picture, the questions as follow: 
1-Customers more likely to spend during black firday?top 20. 
2-costumers ages are more likly attracted in that day and which gender? 
3-items has more sales? top 20.
